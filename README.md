# Holding On To You Drums
These are Drum Sheets for the drum solo during the "lean with it, rock with it"
part in Holding On To You by Twenty One Pilots. This is the live version during
the ERS Tour, maybe Josh also played it like this during the Blurryface and TDC
Tour, I don't know, the Vessel Era Solo is a bit different though. Don't even
get me started on the live versions on RAB and Vessel. I got the information
from a couple of Josh's Instagram and Snapchat Stories the score is written in
Lilypond. (https://www.lilypond.org)
